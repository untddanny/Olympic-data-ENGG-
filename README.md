# Olympic-data-ENGG-
Hello 👋,
I'm thrilled to share my latest project, where I delved into the world of data analysis using Microsoft Azure for the very first time. 🚀
🌐 Project Title: **Tokyo Olympics Data Analysis** 🥇🏟️
🔧 Technologies Utilized:
**Microsoft Azure**: My journey began with setting up and exploring Microsoft Azure, a powerful cloud platform. This versatile tool allowed me to seamlessly manage, store, and analyze data, making it an ideal choice for my project.
**Azure Databricks**: Leveraging Azure Databricks, I was able to process and analyze vast amounts of Tokyo Olympics data efficiently. The collaborative and integrated workspace streamlined my data exploration and analysis, allowing me to derive valuable insights.
**Azure Synapse Analytics**: To take my analysis to the next level, I employed Azure Synapse Analytics. This service facilitated real-time querying and data warehousing, enabling me to uncover hidden patterns and trends within the Olympic data.
📈 Project Highlights:
*Extracted the dataset from GitHub and stored data on Azure.
*Leveraged Azure Databricks for in-depth data transformation and preparation.
*Utilized Azure Synapse Analytics to get meaningful insights.
*Explored various aspects of the Tokyo Olympics, including athlete performance, medal standings, and event trends.

💡 Lessons Learned:
Microsoft Azure offers a robust and user-friendly environment for data analysis and management.
Azure Databricks and Synapse Analytics are essential tools for anyone looking to gain valuable insights from complex datasets.
